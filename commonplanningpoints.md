Have you ever encountered a project not going as per the plan? I am sure you have. Most of the projects in real world fail to comply with one or more aspects of a project plan - schedule, cost and scope. Variance with project plan specifications is inevitable because in a project there are umpteen number of variables. And one variable going out of tune will impact one or more of schedule, cost and scope of a project.

Then what shall we do as a project manager? Shall we stop creating project plans since we know there's going to be deviation? No, certainly not. Accept deviations as part of your project but at the same time, learn from those project deviations to improve your project planning skill so as to reduce the deviations next time.

I have worked with many project managers, certified and otherwise. And what I have seen is most of them do not understand the nitty gritties of project planning. I am listing below some really cool points about project planning which I have learned over time from some really qualified project management professionals. I am sure that by following these practical aspects of project planning, you will be able to come up with a better project plan than you have been preparing till now.

On the same note, I must put a disclaimer that following is not a complete tutorial in project planning. The assumption is that you as a project manager know the various methods, tools and techniques of project planning. And the following is just a list of finer points that you should keep in mind while you are doing a project planning or reviewing a project plan.

### Nitty gritties of a project plan

* Always start the project planning process by creating work breakdown structure (in short called WBS) and identifying the tasks.

```
Alert: One must avoid the temptation of linking tasks simultaneously while identifying them. It is a common mistake that project managers make and then the project planning process becomes too complex to handle.
```

* Only after you have identified all tasks to the best of your knowledge and to the best of the knowledge of a subject matter expert, start putting duration to each task.

```
Alert: No linking of tasks at this stage too.
Another common mistake to avoid - do not (do not-do not-do not) put start and end date of activities. Only define the time taken to complete each activity.
The start and end dates of the activities and subsequently the whole project should be allowed to be calculated automatically based on duration and interdependencies (which you should put next)
```

* Only after all tasks and their durations have been identified, start identifying the dependencies. Once you have finished linking the tasks according to dependencies, you will automatically get the start and end date for each task and the overall project. This approach of avoiding hard coded dates is very important because when you will revise the project plan later during project review sessions, you will not have to worry about updating dates manually.
