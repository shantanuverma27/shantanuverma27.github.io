## Welcome to Project Management resources!

Project management is an evergreen trade. By that, I mean project management is one such profession which has and which will always remain in demand. That is because project management requires a very high degree of such activities which cannot be automated. For example, the project management processes need acumen of risk assessment based on situation. It also requires mediation skills and stakeholder management skill sets which probably no amount of automation can achieve in the current context. May be some day, when the robots will be able to replace humans for decision making in every aspect of life, we may see project management professionals also being replaced by the robots. But till then, project management is here to stay.

Having said that, project management requires its unique set of technical and non-technical skills. Through these pages, I would try to bring to you some of these skills which may help somebody to enhance their knowledge of project management or might also help someone to resolve some issues they might be facing in their projects.

I wish you happy surfing!!
