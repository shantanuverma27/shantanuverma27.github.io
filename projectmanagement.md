## Welcome to Project Management resources!

Most of you would have always thought what rocket science is there in project management. To most of you, project management would have been the easiest and most straight forward trade with hardly any technical expertise required.

Well, you are partially right and partially wrong in your assumption about project management as a trade. Partially right because yes, project management is not a rocket science. And partially wrong because project management is not the most straight forward activity nor is it that it does not involve technical expertise.

Project management requires its own set of technical skills and expertise. Moreover, in addition to the specialized technical skills, project management requires a huge deal of non-technical soft skills. And I sincerely hope that after going through the various resources shared here, you will change your earlier mindset about project management as a trade and appreciate the fact that project management is a specialized function.

So what are you waiting for - go ahead and browse the following resources on project management and I am sure you will like it.
