# What is project management

What is the objective of project management? What should a project manager want to achieve while he is managing a project? Basically, every project management practice should aim at answering the following four questions:

* What - What is the project objective and what are the activities to be performed to accomplish those objectives. Tools like project charter and project plan help us in answering this question.
* When - When can we complete these activities and reach the end result at the earliest as per the scope of the project using the budget assigned to the project. Tools like project plan and resource plan help us answer this question
* Is it on schedule - Once in the middle of the project, answer if the project is on schedule, within budget and conforming to the scope or not. Tools like milestone meetings, critical path (CPM), cost and time variance analysis, earned value help to answer this question.
* What if not on schedule - How to complete the project if there is deviation from schedule and when will it get completed with the adjusted project constraints. Critical path method, project recovery, cost crashing etc are tools to answer this question.

Project management is nothing but a systematic way of applying these tools to answer the above 4 questions of a project at any given time during the life cycle of the project.
