## Welcome to my website

My name is Shantanu Verma. I have created this website to share some skills and best practices with all of you based on my experiences in my professional and non-professional life. Here you will find resources on various topics that I have been exposed to. And I hope these resources will help people in some way or other.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shantanuverma27/shantanuverma27.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
