# Welcome to my website

My name is Shantanu Verma. I have great interest in project management, data science and machine learning.

In my professional experience, I have seen that whenever we talk of data science and machine learning, we usually talk about roles such as data analyst, data engineer and machine learning engineer. But I have never come across a role which talks about project management of data science projects. And I often wonder why!!

It is a well established fact that the skillsets required for an IT project management is different ------ More to come
