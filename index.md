Hello there!! My name is Shantanu Verma.

I am a project management enthusiast. I have a vast experience of managing complex and critical projects across functions as varied as IT, risk management, compliance, L1 & L2 support, business continuity management, facilities management, accounts receivable processes and others.

The intention of creating my website is to share some skills and best practices with all of you which I have gathered in my professional and non-professional life. On this site, you will find resources on various topics that I think will help someone or other in achieving his/ her desired objective.
